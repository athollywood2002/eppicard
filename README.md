Eppicard script for balance. Python-2.7 and requests.

This is a simple script that is ran from the command line. It connects to the www.eppicard.com website, 
enters your username and password, and returns your current balance. 
 
You must enter your username and password into the script and save it for future use. This is not to be 
used on a open network. Never have your username and password saved in a script on a open network. 

Make the script executalbe and it will give you your balance without having to interact with the eppicard website. 

Saves time and money.
